First, put all the green chutney ingredients in a blender and run it for a bit
then toast the bread
While those are working, start mashing up the boild potatos
after the potatos are mashed(keep checking on the other elements), get your spices out
Add a little at a time, and keep tasting for what you want. You can even add other spices, like amchur powder.
Apply chutney and hot sauce to the bread
put the mashed potatos on top
Then put the sandwich into the gridle one more time.
Enjoy :)
